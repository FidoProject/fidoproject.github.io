			<h4>about fido</h4>
			<p>Real-time machine learning is the next step for mobile, integrated intelligent systems.  However, most solutions are designed for laboratory-only use, and cannot be practically implemented in real-world resource-limited environments.  <strong>Meet Fido</strong>, the machine learning library designed for integrated high-performance practical operation; Fido can run smoothly on devices from AVR micro-controllers to Raspberry Pi's.</p>

			<p>Fido is loosely organized into three types of tools: <code>systems</code>, <code>widgets</code>, and <code>utilities</code>.  Widgets are classes that represent useful machine learning devices: examples include neurons, layers, and neural networks.  Utilities are what they say on the tin: examples include activation functions.  Finally, systems are complete constructions of widgets, utilities, and other systems to form fully functional devices.   This is what makes Fido truly powerful: a physical robot that learns from positive and negative reinforcement is only a line of code away.</p>

			<h4>getting started</h4>
			<p>First, download the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/FidoProject/Fido/releases">Github</a>.  In the downloaded zip you will find amalgamated header and source files, <code>Fido.h</code> and <code>Fido.cpp</code>.  Now, simply add the two files to your project and put the following at the top of wherever you're using Fido:</p>

			<pre>#include &lt;Fido.h&gt;</pre>

			<p>And you're done!  For more information please visit the <a href="/docs">docs</a>.</p>

			<h4>who is fido</h4>
			<p>Fido was created by programmers <span id="nameOne"><a href="https://github.com/joshuagruenstein/">Joshua Gruenstein</a></span> and <span id="nameTwo"><a href="https://github.com/truell20/">Michael Truell</a></span> from the Horace Mann School.  The project was started as a universal robot control system using limited feedback, which can be read about <a href="/research">here</a>.  Fido still continues to be developed in this direction, and the research is included in the library as systems.
