		<h2>Fido Research</h2>
		<p>The development of a universal robot control system using limited feedback, implemented using the Fido library.</p>
		<hr>

		<div class="sec" id="concept">
			<h4>project concept</h4>

			<p>The Fido project originally started as a universal robot control system, created as part of a Science Research class to address the following goals:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trainability:</strong> Allow both human and autonomous training rather than pre-programming</li>
				<li><strong>Universality:</strong> Run on any robot, even without prior knowledge of the host</li>
			</ul>

			<p>These goals were achieved through the training of artificial neural networks with a wire-fitted moving least squares interpolator following the Q-learning reinforcement algorithm and an action selection policy that utilizes a Boltzmann distribution of probability, all implemented using the Fido library.</p>

			<h4>experimentation</h4>
			<p>The control system was initially tested using the Fido simulator, allowing rapid prototyping and iteration.  Next, a small <a href="https://github.com/FidoProject/Hardware">robot</a> using the Intel Edison compute module was constructed for physical testing. The robot was successfully trained to do a variety of tasks with limited feedback, such as staying put, moving only in the dark, and driving to a point.  Reward was given to the robot over wifi through an <a href="https://github.com/FidoProject/RewardApp">app</a> developed in the Ionic framework.</p>

			<p>Another hardware implementation, this time implemented on a Raspberry Pi Zero, is currently in development.</p>
